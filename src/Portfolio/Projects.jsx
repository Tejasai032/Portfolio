         <p> I completed my Java Full Stack Developer internship at Yoktha Technologies, where I was tasked with creating an online library system for borrowing books. 
          I developed the website using Eclipse Enterprise, utilizing JSP for the HTML and CSS content, and enhanced its interactivity with JavaScript for real-time search and dynamic updates. 
          I also implemented servlets for database connections and managed the SQL database to handle user accounts, inventory, and transactions. The result was a user-friendly, fully functional full-stack website.
